[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gz_ros", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz_ros" with any
  of the following names:

    gz_rosConfig.cmake
    gz_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gz_ros"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
